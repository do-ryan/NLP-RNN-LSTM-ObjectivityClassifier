the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments . 	1
ratliff deserves high marks for his restraint and willingness not to try and shape or mold our opinion regarding what is being shown . 	1

for the first time in years , de niro digs deep emotionally , perhaps because he's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars . 	1
it is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness . 	1

to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career . 	1

an unsentimental albeit heartfelt eulogy to the firefighters who paid the ultimate price while saving new yorkers . 	1

it looks closely , insightfully at fragile , complex relationships . 	1

it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment . 	1

an off-beat and fanciful film about the human need for monsters to blame for all that is amiss in the world . 	1
the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously . 	1

this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 	1

heaven is a haunting dramatization of a couple's moral ascension . 	1
